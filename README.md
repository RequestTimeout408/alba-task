# Work sample / Task for Albacross

This project's structure is based on [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) by [David Zukowski](https://github.com/davezuko).

For this work sample I've put together a React application that uses Redux, D3 and THREE.

One of the main things to look out for in this app is how D3 is used to provide data structuring and layout in the 2D space and both THREE and D3 are being used for data rendering in 3D and 2D respectively. 

## Installation
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Testing
Test definistions for Karma are located in `/test`
```
$ npm test    #  Run Tests using Karma
```

## Lint
```
$ npm lint     # Run lint
$ npm lint:fix # Run lint with --fix flag
```
